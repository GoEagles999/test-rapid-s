Node version 16. Run 'npm run dev' to transpile TS file, then run 'node dist/index.js'

Deployment can be done via a self-hosted GitHub runner on an AWS EC2 instance for CI/CD, otherwise simply clone repo on the server. Need to make sure the node process has the required permissions for file system calls.
